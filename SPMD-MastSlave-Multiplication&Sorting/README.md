SPMD (Message Passing) Master-Slave matrix vector multiplication and sorting
============

Matrix vector product using Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) with Send/Receive and collective operations. Then it sorts the resulting vector using a master-slave architecture. It prints computation time and different statistics. I developed this project for the Concurrency and Parallelism course in the sophomore year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain).
